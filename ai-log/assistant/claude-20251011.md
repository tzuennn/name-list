tzuennn: Follow instructions in [speckit.implement.prompt.md](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md).
Now work on user story 2

GitHub Copilot: I'll continue implementing User Story 2 (Remove a Name) following the TDD approach outlined in the tasks. Let me start by setting up a todo list and implementing the required tests first. 

Created 4 todos

Now I'll create the contract tests for T030 - DELETE API testing: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/contract/test_delete_api.py)

Now I'll create the integration tests for T031 - remove flow testing: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/integration/test_remove_flow.py)

Now I'll create the accessibility validation notes for T032: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/a11y/US2-notes.md)

Now let me update my todo list and run the new tests to verify they pass: 

Starting (4/4) *Validate US2 implementation*

Let me run the new contract tests for US2: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

There's an issue with the TOML configuration file. Let me check and fix the pyproject.toml file: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/pyproject.toml)

The issue is with the regex patterns - the backslashes need to be escaped in TOML. Let me fix this: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me run the tests from the backend directory where the working directory is correct: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && python -m pytest tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

The database isn't running. Let me start the services: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ© && docker-compose --project-name namelist up -d

Now let me run the contract tests: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && python -m pytest tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

Let me check if the database is running on the correct port: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose --project-name namelist ps

The database is running on port 5432, not 5433. Let me update the conftest.py: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I also need to revert the docker-compose port change: 

Using "Replace String in File"

Let me check the current docker-compose.yml: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/docker-compose.yml#1-1), lines 1 to 16

Good, it's already on 5432. Now let me run the tests: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

There's still the issue with the local PostgreSQL. Let me check if there's a local PostgreSQL service that's interfering: 

Ran terminal command: lsof -i :5432

There's both a local PostgreSQL and Docker PostgreSQL running. The local one is taking precedence. Let me use a different port for Docker to avoid conflicts: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: docker-compose --project-name namelist down && docker-compose --project-name namelist up -d

Now let me test the connection and run the tests: 

Ran terminal command: python -c "import psycopg2; conn = psycopg2.connect(host='localhost', port=5433, dbname='appdb', user='appuser', password='apppass'); print('Connection successful')"

Great! Now let me run the DELETE API tests: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

Let me run from the backend directory: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/contract/test_delete_api.py -v

Great! The contract tests are passing. Now let me run the integration tests: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/integration/test_remove_flow.py -v

Excellent! Both sets of tests are passing. Let me run all the tests together to get proper coverage: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/ -v

There's an issue with the test where it's finding duplicate entries from previous test runs. Let me fix this by making the test names more unique and cleaning up the test: 

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

Made changes.

tzuennn: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Let me also fix the similar issue in the second test: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me run the integration test again: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/integration/test_remove_flow.py::TestRemoveFlow::test_add_delete_flow_consistent_state -v

Great! The test is now passing. Let me run all tests to verify everything is working: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/ -v

Excellent! All tests are passing with 98% coverage. Now let me mark the completed tasks in the tasks.md file and test the live application: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me test the live application to verify User Story 2 is working correctly: 

Ran terminal command: curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/names" | python -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); print(f'Current items: {len(data)}'); [print(f'  {i[\"id\"]}: {i[\"name\"]}') for i in data[-3:]]"

Let me add a test name and then delete it to verify the flow: 

Ran terminal command: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"TestDeleteFlow"}' http://localhost:8080/api/names

Ran terminal command: curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/names" | python -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); test_entry = [i for i in data if i['name'] == 'TestDeleteFlow'][0]; print(f'Test entry: ID {test_entry[\"id\"]} - {test_entry[\"name\"]}')"

Ran terminal command: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/names/77

Ran terminal command: curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/names" | python -c "import sys, json; data=json.load(sys.stdin); deleted_check = [i for i in data if i['name'] == 'TestDeleteFlow']; print(f'TestDeleteFlow found after deletion: {len(deleted_check)} (should be 0)')"

Perfect! Let me check the frontend is working: 

Ran terminal command: curl -s http://localhost:8080/ | grep -E "(delete-btn|aria-label)" | head -3

Let me update my todo list to mark completion:

Made changes.

tzuennn: Follow instructions in [speckit.implement.prompt.md](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md).
Proceed with user story 3. Current implementation lacks the sorting and pagination feature

GitHub Copilot: I'll implement User Story 3 (Sorting & Pagination) following the TDD approach. Let me start by setting up a todo list and implementing the required tests first. 

Created 10 todos

Since US3 involves frontend JavaScript testing, I'll create unit tests for the sorting utilities first. Let me create a test file for the sorting functions: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/unit)

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/unit/test_sorting.js)

Now let me create the integration test documentation for T041: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/integration)

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/integration/test_sort_and_paginate.md)

Now let me create the accessibility validation notes for T042: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/a11y/US3-notes.md)

Summarized conversation historyPerfect! Now let me update the todo list to mark T042 as completed and move on to T044 (creating the sorting controls UI): 

Starting (4/10) *Add sorting controls UI*

Now let me read the current frontend HTML to understand the existing structure before adding the sorting controls: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/html/index.html)

Now let me add the sorting controls to the HTML. I'll add them between the "List" heading and the actual list, following the accessibility requirements from the test notes: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the sorting controls HTML structure: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now let me complete the sorting controls UI task and move on to implementing the sorting functions. Let me update the todo list: 

Starting (5/10) *Implement sorting functions*

Now let me read the current app.js to understand the existing structure before adding the sorting functions: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/html/app.js)

Now I need to implement the sorting functionality. Based on the test specifications I created earlier, I need to add:

1. Global state for current sort mode
2. Sorting functions for names (A‚ÜíZ, Z‚ÜíA) and dates (newest/oldest)  
3. Event handlers for sorting buttons
4. Integration with the existing renderList function 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me update the fetchNames function to store the data and use sorting: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the event listeners for the sorting buttons at the end of the file: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now let me mark the sorting functions task as completed and move on to adding pagination controls. Let me update the todo list: 

Starting (6/10) *Add pagination controls UI*

Now let me add the pagination controls to the HTML. I'll add them after the list element: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the pagination HTML structure after the list: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now let me complete the pagination controls UI task and move to implementing the pagination logic. Let me update the todo list: 

Starting (7/10) *Implement pagination logic*

Now let me implement the pagination logic in the JavaScript. I need to add pagination state and functions to the beginning of the app.js file: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add pagination utility functions after the sorting functions: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to update the setSortMode and fetchNames functions to work with pagination: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add the event listeners for pagination controls at the end of the file: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! Now let me mark the pagination logic task as completed and move to testing. Let me update the todo list: 

Starting (8/10) *Run frontend unit tests*

Now let me test the implementation by running the backend tests first to make sure the foundation still works, then I'll need to start the application to manually test the new sorting and pagination features: 

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

Made changes.

tzuennn: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/ -v

Excellent! All backend tests are still passing with 98% coverage. Now let me start the application to manually test the new sorting and pagination features: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose up

Let me check the docker-compose.yml to see what's causing the image name issue: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/docker-compose.yml)

The docker-compose.yml looks correct. Let me check if there's a .env file that might be needed: 

Ran terminal command: ls -la | grep env

Let me check the .env file: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/.env)

The issue might be with Docker image naming. Let me try to clean up and rebuild the containers: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans

Ran terminal command: docker-compose build --no-cache

The issue is that the directory name "HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©" is causing Docker to create invalid image names. Let me try a different approach and run the services individually without Docker Compose for now. Let me first run the backend directly: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

Now let me start PostgreSQL in the background first. I'll use a simpler approach and run postgres locally: 

Ran terminal command: docker run --rm -d --name test-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=appuser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=apppass -e POSTGRES_DB=appdb -p 5433:5432 postgres:16-alpine

Let me check what's using port 5433: 

Ran terminal command: docker ps -a | grep postgres

There's already a PostgreSQL container running. Let me use that one. Now let me initialize the database schema: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ© && docker exec -i db psql -U appuser -d appdb < db/init.sql

Good! Now let me start the backend with the correct database connection: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433 DB_NAME=appdb DB_USER=appuser DB_PASSWORD=apppass python app.py

Checked background terminal output

It seems the app.py finished immediately. Let me check the app.py to see if it needs to be run with Flask: 

Ran terminal command: DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433 DB_NAME=appdb DB_USER=appuser DB_PASSWORD=apppass flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

Let me set the FLASK_APP environment variable: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433 DB_NAME=appdb DB_USER=appuser DB_PASSWORD=apppass FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

Checked background terminal output

Perfect! The backend is now running on port 8000. Now I need to serve the frontend. Let me use a simple HTTP server: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/frontend/html && python -m http.server 3000

However, I need to modify the frontend to point to the correct backend URL. Let me update the app.js to use the correct backend endpoint: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
I need to handle CORS since the frontend and backend are on different ports. Let me check if the backend has CORS configured: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/app.py#1-1), lines 1 to 21

I need to add CORS support. Let me modify the backend to add CORS headers: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
The lint errors are just IDE warnings since we're in the wrong directory. Let me restart the backend with the updated CORS: 

Ran terminal command: pkill -f "flask run"

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/backend && DB_HOST=localhost DB_PORT=5433 DB_NAME=appdb DB_USER=appuser DB_PASSWORD=apppass FLASK_APP=app.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_ÊõæÂ≠êÊÅ©/frontend/html && python -m http.server 3000

Perfect! Now let me test the application by opening it in the browser: 

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost:3000

Made changes.

tzuennn: Note it should run on localhost:8080
not 3000
‚Ä¢ Run Flask using Gunicorn inside the container, bound to 0.0.0.0:8000.
‚Ä¢ Expose only the Nginx container to the host (e.g., port 8080:80).

GitHub Copilot: You're absolutely right! The application should be properly containerized and accessible on localhost:8080. Let me fix the Docker setup and use the proper architecture with Nginx as the frontend proxy and Flask with Gunicorn as the backend.

First, let me check the current Docker setup and make the necessary corrections: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/docker-compose.yml)

The docker-compose.yml looks correct. Now let me check the backend Dockerfile to make sure it's using Gunicorn: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/Dockerfile)

Good! The backend Dockerfile is correctly configured with Gunicorn. Let me check if Gunicorn is in the requirements.txt: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/requirements.txt)

Perfect! Now let me check the frontend Dockerfile and nginx configuration: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/Dockerfile)

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/nginx.conf)

The configuration looks perfect! Now I need to revert the frontend app.js to use relative URLs instead of absolute localhost URLs since nginx will proxy the API calls: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now I need to remove the CORS headers from the backend since nginx will handle the proxy and CORS won't be needed: 

Using "Replace String in File"

Let me first read the current state of the backend app.py: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/app.py)

Now I can remove the CORS headers since nginx will handle the proxy: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me stop the previous services and start the application properly with Docker Compose: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose down

Ran terminal command: docker-compose build --no-cache

The issue is still with the directory name containing Chinese characters. Let me work around this by specifying explicit image names in the docker-compose.yml: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me try building again: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose build --no-cache

Excellent! The build succeeded. Now let me start all the services: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose up -d

There's a naming conflict with an existing container. Let me clean up the existing containers first: 

Ran terminal command: docker ps -a

Ran terminal command: docker stop db backend frontend && docker rm db backend frontend

Now let me start the services again: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose up -d

Perfect! All services are running. Let me check the status: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose ps

Excellent! Now let me test the application by opening it in the browser: 

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost:8080

Made changes.

tzuennn: all the buttpms are not responsive to click, the page numbers, the sorting as well all not working. Why is that so? What is he root cause

GitHub Copilot: Let me investigate why the buttons are not responsive. This could be due to several issues. Let me first check if the application is properly loading by examining the browser console and network requests. 

Opened Simple Browser at http://localhost:8080

Now let me check the application logs to see if there are any JavaScript errors or if the app.js file is being loaded correctly: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose logs frontend

I can see from the logs that the API calls are working (POST/GET/DELETE requests are successful), and the app.js file is being loaded successfully (GET app.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13767). This suggests the issue might be with the JavaScript code itself.

Let me check if there are any JavaScript console errors by examining the actual file being served. The issue could be that the new sorting and pagination code has JavaScript errors that prevent the event listeners from being attached.

Let me check if there's a mismatch between what's in the Docker container vs the local files: 

Ran terminal command: docker exec -it hw3_frontend_1 ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html/

Let me check the current app.js file to see if there are any obvious JavaScript errors: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/html/app.js#1-1), lines 1 to 51

The beginning looks fine. Let me check around the event listener section since that's where the problem likely is: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/html/app.js#440-440), lines 440 to 473

I found the **root cause**! The issue is that the Docker container is still serving the **old version** of the app.js file that doesn't have the new sorting and pagination functionality. The container was built before I added the new features.

The key evidence:
1. From the logs: `"GET app.js HTTP/1.1" 200 13767` - the file size is 13767 bytes
2. The current app.js file is 473 lines and much larger
3. The container was built earlier when the file was smaller

I need to rebuild the frontend container to include the updated app.js file with all the sorting and pagination features: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose build frontend
