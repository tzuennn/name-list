GitHub Copilot: I'll continue executing the implementation plan from where I left off. Since the user undid my previous changes, I need to restart the implementation phase following the TDD approach outlined in the tasks. 

Updated todo list

Let me check the current state of the foundational tasks by examining T010 (database schema) first: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose up -d db

Ran terminal command: docker exec db psql -U postgres -d names -c "\d names"

Let me check the .env file to understand the correct database credentials: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/.env)

Now let me verify the database schema with the correct credentials: 

Ran terminal command: docker exec db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "\d names"

Perfect! T010 is complete - the database schema is properly loaded. Now I'll implement the missing tests following the TDD approach. First, let me add the test infrastructure: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/conftest.py)

I need to install pytest first. Let me add it to requirements.txt and install: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

Now I'll create the unit tests for T020 (validation tests): 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/unit/test_validation.py)

Let me run the unit tests to verify they work (the import error is just VS Code not recognizing the newly installed package): 

Ran terminal command: cd backend && python -m pytest tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

I need to set up the environment variables for testing. Let me modify the conftest.py to handle testing environment: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

The tests need to connect to the Docker database. Let me adjust the DB_HOST to point to the running Docker container: 

Using "Replace String in File"

The DB is running in Docker, so I need to make sure it's accessible on localhost. Let me check if the database port is accessible: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose ps

Good, the database is exposed on port 5432. Let me try connecting directly to verify credentials: 

Ran terminal command: docker exec db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "SELECT 1 as test"

Database is working fine. Let me test the connection from localhost: 

Ran terminal command: python -c "import psycopg2; conn = psycopg2.connect(host='localhost', port=5432, dbname='appdb', user='appuser', password='apppass'); print('Connection successful')"

There seems to be an issue with the database setup. Let me check what users exist in the database: 

Ran terminal command: docker exec db psql -U appuser -d appdb -c "\du"

The user exists in the container. The issue might be with IPv6 vs IPv4. Let me try 127.0.0.1: 

Ran terminal command: python -c "import psycopg2; conn = psycopg2.connect(host='127.0.0.1', port=5432, dbname='appdb', user='appuser', password='apppass'); print('Connection successful')"

Let me check if there's a local PostgreSQL running that might be interfering: 

Ran terminal command: lsof -i :5432

There's a local PostgreSQL running on port 5432 as well as Docker. The local one is taking precedence. Let me adjust the Docker port or use the Docker database directly for tests: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d db

Let me modify the docker-compose.yml to use a different port for the database to avoid conflicts: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/docker-compose.yml)

Let me change the Docker DB to use a different port to avoid conflict with local PostgreSQL:

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

Great! The tests are passing but the coverage is failing because it's not including the app.py module. Let me fix the coverage configuration and run pytest from the correct directory: 

Ran terminal command: cd backend && python -m pytest tests/unit/test_validation.py -v --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

Let me fix the pytest configuration and run it properly: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: PYTHONPATH=/Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_曾子恩/backend python -m pytest backend/tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

Let me run the tests from the backend directory itself: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/unit/test_validation.py -v

Excellent! T020 (unit validation tests) is now complete and passing with good coverage. Now let me create the contract tests for T021: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/contract/test_names_api.py)

Now let me create the integration test for T022: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/backend/tests/integration/test_add_persist.py)

Now let me create the accessibility notes for T023: 

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/a11y)

Created [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/frontend/tests/a11y/US1-notes.md)

Now let me run the contract and integration tests to verify they pass: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/contract/test_names_api.py -v

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/integration/test_add_persist.py -v

Great! The tests are passing. Let me run all the tests together to get the right coverage: 

Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/ -v

There's a test issue - the database has duplicate test entries from previous runs. Let me fix the test to handle this by making the test names unique: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Ran terminal command: python -m pytest tests/ -v

Excellent! All tests are passing with 97% coverage. Now let me enhance the frontend delete button accessibility as required by T034 and mark completed tasks in the tasks.md file: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me mark the completed tasks in the tasks.md file: 

Read [](file:///Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_%E6%9B%BE%E5%AD%90%E6%81%A9/specs/001-refactor-and-harden/tasks.md#42-42), lines 42 to 72

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me mark T010 as complete and T034 as complete: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me test the full application by starting all services to ensure everything is working: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose up -d

There seems to be an issue with the Docker image name. Let me check the current status and rebuild: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose build backend

The issue is with the project name in docker-compose. Let me check the current working directory name which is affecting the Docker image naming: 

Ran terminal command: pwd

I need to be in the project root. Let me change directory and restart the services: 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/tzuentseng/CSMods/cloud/HW3_曾子恩 && docker-compose up -d

The project directory name contains characters that aren't valid for Docker image names. Let me set an explicit project name in docker-compose: 

Ran terminal command: docker-compose --project-name namelist up -d

Perfect! Now let me test the application to ensure US1 is working correctly: 

Ran terminal command: curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/names | python -m json.tool

Great! The API is working and I can see that:
1. T024 is complete - the API includes `created_at` and orders by insertion (`id`)
2. The order is correct (oldest→newest by ID)
3. All the test data from our test runs is persisting correctly

Let me test adding a new name: 

Ran terminal command: curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Integration Test"}' http://localhost:8080/api/names

Ran terminal command: curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/names | tail -5

Perfect! I can see the new "Integration Test" entry with ID 33 was added at the end. Let me test the delete functionality: 

Ran terminal command: curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/names/33

Now let me test the frontend is accessible: 

Ran terminal command: curl -s http://localhost:8080/ | head -10

Excellent! Let me update my todo list and provide a final validation summary:
