# Feature Specification: Refactor & improve Name List App

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-and-improve`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Refactor and improve a 3-tier Name List web app to open‑source quality using Spec‑Driven Development. Names can be added and removed; persisted across sessions; ordered by time added; add sorting by A→Z/Z→A and by last added date."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Add a name and see the persisted list (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to add a name to the list and still see it after I refresh or return later, so I can maintain a simple roster that persists across sessions. The default view shows names ordered by the time they were added (oldest to newest).

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the app (capture and persist names). Without it, the app provides no utility.

**Independent Test**: Add a single name to an empty list, refresh/return, verify the name remains; verify default ordering by time added.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given an empty list, when I enter "Alice" and submit, then I see "Alice" in the list and a success indication.
2. Given a list with ["Alice"], when I add "Bob", then I see ["Alice", "Bob"] (ordered by time added) and both remain after a page reload.
3. Given a list, when adding a blank or whitespace-only name, then the system prevents submission and shows a helpful message.

**UX States**:

- Loading: Initial load shows a skeleton or spinner with list region reserved.
- Empty: A friendly empty state indicates "No names yet" and prompts to add one.
- Error: Clear, human-readable error with retry; no technical stack traces are shown.
- Success: The new name appears in the list and input is cleared with subtle confirmation.

**Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)**:

- Landmarks/semantics: Input has associated label; list uses semantic list roles.
- Keyboard flow and focus order: Focus remains visible; submit via Enter works; focus returns to input or a confirmation region.
- Contrast and labels: Meets contrast ratios; error/success messages are announced to assistive tech.

**Performance**:

- Measurement method: Observe end-to-end time-to-visibility for added name and page reload list display using user timings; target under 1 second on typical hardware/network.

### User Story 2 - Remove a name (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to remove a name from the list so that the roster stays accurate and up to date across sessions.

**Why this priority**: Data accuracy is essential; removing items prevents clutter and errors.

**Independent Test**: Remove a specific name, reload/return, verify it no longer appears and the remaining order is preserved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a list ["Alice", "Bob"], when I remove "Alice", then the list becomes ["Bob"] and remains so after reload.
2. Given a list with a single name, when I remove it, then I see the empty state and no errors occur.
3. Given a transient network error during removal, when I retry, then the operation eventually succeeds or shows a clear failure with next steps.

### User Story 3 - Sort the list by name or time added (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want to change how the list is ordered so I can quickly find items: sort A→Z or Z→A by name, and sort by last added date (newest first or oldest first).

**Why this priority**: Sorting improves findability and supports different review tasks.

**Independent Test**: Toggle between A→Z, Z→A, newest-first, oldest-first on an existing list and verify the visual order updates accordingly without changing stored insertion sequence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given ["Charlie", "Alice", "Bob"], when I choose A→Z, then the visual order is ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"].
2. Given any list, when I choose Z→A, then the visual order is the exact reverse of A→Z sorting by name.
3. Given a list with timestamps, when I choose newest-first by added date, then the most recently added name appears first; when I choose oldest-first, then the original default (time added) ordering is shown.

### Edge Cases

- Blank or whitespace-only input is rejected with guidance.
- Duplicate names [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are duplicates allowed or should names be unique?].
- Very long names (e.g., >100 characters) are truncated or rejected with guidance.
- Unicode names (accents/emoji/CJK) display and sort correctly per locale rules.
- Simultaneous operations: if two actions occur quickly (add then remove), the list remains consistent after refresh.
- Default scope [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is the list global to all users or per-user?].
- List size [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a maximum list size and/or pagination requirement?].
- Duplicate names are allowed; each occurrence is a separate entry.
- Scope is per user device: each user's computer has its own list.
- Pagination adapts to viewport: default 20 per page; if 20 exceeds viewport height, use a smaller page size to avoid vertical overflow.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to add a name to the list via a simple form with validation.
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to remove a specific name from the list.
- **FR-003**: The list MUST persist across sessions; on returning, users see previously saved names.
- **FR-004**: The default list view MUST be ordered by time added (oldest to newest) upon initial load.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to sort names alphabetically A→Z and Z→A.
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to sort by last added date: newest-first and oldest-first.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST prevent submission of empty or whitespace-only names, providing actionable feedback.
- **FR-008**: The interface MUST expose clear Loading, Empty, Error, and Success states.
- **FR-009**: The experience MUST meet accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA semantics, focus, contrast, labels).
- **FR-010**: Errors MUST be presented in plain language with retry guidance; no technical stack traces to users.
- **FR-011**: The list MUST display Unicode names correctly; sorting respects locale-aware ordering.
- **FR-012**: Sorting controls MUST change only the visual order; the underlying insertion timestamps remain unchanged.
- **FR-013**: The system SHOULD handle large lists gracefully (e.g., 1,000 entries) without noticeable slowdowns.
- **FR-014**: After add/remove, the list view MUST update within 1 second under normal conditions.
- **FR-015**: Duplicate names are allowed; adding a name with identical text creates another entry and is displayed as such.
- **FR-016**: The list is per user device; each user's computer maintains its own list independent of others.
- **FR-017**: Pagination default is 20 entries per page; page size MUST adapt to ensure the list does not exceed the vertical viewport (reduce page size as needed to prevent vertical overflow beyond standard page scrolling expectations).

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Name**: Represents a single entry in the list; attributes: identifier, display text, time added.
- **Sorting Preference**: Represents the currently selected visual ordering; values include A→Z, Z→A, newest-first, oldest-first.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add a valid name and see it appear within 1 second in 95% of attempts.
- **SC-002**: After a page reload, previously added names are restored 100% of the time.
- **SC-003**: Sorting toggles update the visual order correctly in 100% of observed cases during testing.
- **SC-004**: 90% of users successfully complete add and remove tasks on first attempt in usability checks.
- **SC-005**: Accessibility: All interactive elements are keyboard accessible; a11y audit score ≥ 90.
- **SC-006**: Perceived load: initial list displays within 1 second for existing data in 95% of attempts.
- **SC-007**: Pagination respects viewport: default 20 entries per page; in 100% of tested viewports, the page size adapts to avoid vertical overflow caused by the list component.
